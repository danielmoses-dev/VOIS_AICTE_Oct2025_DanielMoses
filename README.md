# Airbnb Data Analysis â€“ VOIS x Edunet Foundation Internship

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **VOIS (Vodafone Intelligent Solutions)** x **Edunet Foundation** 4-week internship program. The objective of this task was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an Airbnb dataset to gain insights into property listings, host behavior, pricing factors, and overall market patterns across various neighbourhoods.

---

## Objectives

The main goals of this project were:

* To analyze the **distribution of room types** and their pricing.
* To identify **which neighbourhood groups dominate** the Airbnb listings.
* To understand **how construction year influences property pricing**.
* To discover **top-performing hosts** based on listing count and reviews.
* To explore **relationships between service fees, prices, and reviews**.
* To derive **data-driven insights** that could inform host and business strategies.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** â€“ Core programming language
* **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Interactive environment for analysis
* **Pandas** â€“ Data cleaning and manipulation
* **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Visualization and pattern discovery

---

## Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Before performing analysis, several key preprocessing steps were taken:

* **Removed duplicate records** to ensure data integrity.
* **Checked and handled missing values** in essential columns like `price`, `reviews_per_month`, and `host_id`.
* **Inspected and standardized important columns** such as `room_type`, `neighbourhood_group`, and `availability_365`.
* **Converted data types** where necessary to ensure accurate aggregation and plotting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis & Visual Insights

A structured EDA was performed to uncover trends and insights in the dataset. Key visualizations included:

### 1. **Types of Rooms**

Explored the proportions of room types (Entire home/apartment, Private room, Shared room, etc.) to understand guest preferences.

### 2. **Neighbourhood Group with Highest Listing**

Identified which neighbourhood groups have the highest Airbnb presence, revealing the most popular areas for rentals.

### 3. **Neighbourhood Group with Highest Average Price**

Compared average pricing across neighbourhood groups to find premium and budget-friendly zones.

### 4. **Relation between Construction Year and Price of Property**

Analyzed how the year a property was built correlates with its listed price, offering insight into property value trends.

### 5. **Top 10 Hosts**

Listed and visualized the most active hosts based on total listings, highlighting top contributors on the platform.

### 6. **Relation between Verified Identities and Positive Reviews**

Examined how verified host identities influence customer trust and review positivity.

### 7. **Correlation between Price and Service Fee of Listing**

Explored how service fees scale with listing prices, revealing the fee structure dynamics on Airbnb.

### 8. **Average Review Rate Number**

Visualized the average number of reviews to understand engagement levels across listings.

### 9. **Hosts with Higher Listing Counts vs Availability**

Compared host listing counts with yearly availability to detect operational patterns among top hosts.

## Key Insights

* **Entire homes/apartments** dominate Airbnb listings, reflecting guest preference for privacy.
* Certain **neighbourhood groups** consistently show higher listing density and average pricing.
* **Older properties** tend to be priced lower, whereas modern constructions often fetch premium rates.
* **Top hosts** maintain strong visibility and listing consistency year-round.
* **Verified hosts** tend to receive more positive reviews, indicating higher trust and guest satisfaction.
* **Price and service fee** show a moderate positive correlation, suggesting proportional pricing policies.

## Learnings & Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my ability to:

* Perform **comprehensive data cleaning** and transformation workflows.
* Apply **visual analytics** to uncover meaningful business insights.
* Build **narrative-driven EDA reports** using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
* Interpret real-world datasets to support **data-informed decision-making**.

---

## Future Work

Possible extensions for this project include:

* Predicting **Airbnb listing prices** using regression models.
* Creating a **dashboard** for interactive exploration of listings and trends.
* Performing **sentiment analysis** on textual reviews for deeper insights.
